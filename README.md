# tp_lab
my uni project which i made for myself.  
  
  This application for accounting documents about cars(i wrote front-end using react).  
  Users have different roles(admin and worker), so they have different rules.  
  The main technologies are:  
- `chi-router`;
- `pgx` for driver;
- `sqlx`;
- `zap`;
- `gorilla/websocket`;  
  
  Workers can create docs and get docs. Admin can delete, update, create and get workers and docs. Everyone can create chat room to send messages.
  The chat logic is pretty simple.
